README.md

This is just a place I'm maintaining my learing progress, comments and progress as I learn swift. My actual swift apps will have separate repositories like arguMate, hifzhelper etc

I'm following this course by Paul Hegarty 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316

progress and notes are in the form of independent commits as well as hand notes i'm taking in a book, which i'll some day upload as pdf.
