README.md

- This is just a place I'm maintaining my random learning  progress trying out new things, ideas etc , comments and progress as I learn swift. My actual swift apps will have separate repositories like arguMate, hifzhelper etc
- purpose really is quite selfish: to be able to git clone as I move across laptops over the years, so I can keep all the code I wrote in the ether and not lose it, and 
- able to run grep in these directories to review my old code, for rapid re-use

Amongst the usual myriad of learning options on the internet, including safaribooks, I'm also following this course by Paul Hegarty 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316

progress and notes are in the form of independent commits as well as hand notes i'm taking in a book, which i'll some day upload as pdf.
