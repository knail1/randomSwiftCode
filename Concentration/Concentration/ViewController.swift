    // swift is extremely strongly typed language, you have to be VERY specific in what you want to use
    // also has strong type inference (it will guess type for you) so you could have used:
    
    var flipCount = 0 {
        didSet {
            // this code observes this variable changing and everytime it changes, this {}
            // segment executes the code... so let's move the flipCoundLabel here..

    // now we'll write a functin which does flips the card over and presents the emoji
    // when the card (button) is clicked
    // it will take the emoji you want to show presented up on this card when flipped
    // and the button on which you want that emoji to be flipped (heck thats all the work!)

        // object and see what "TouchUPInide" is calling and update it just to call the
        // required IBAction function.
        
        // let's pring variable passed to function called sender of type UIButton
        //print("touchCard(\(sender))")

        // that we connected each of the cards to.

        // in a set state it can have Data associated with it

        // if the card is not connected to the cardButtons array,  and the card is clicked, this code segment would try to unwrap the the index of this card from cardNumber and find NIL instead, this will crash the program
